R code to scrape the keywords from three blogs dedicated to the study of French conspiracy theorists – [Confusionnisme](http://confusionnisme.info/) (2014–2015), [Conspiracy Watch](http://www.conspiracywatch.info/) (2002–2015), and [Conspis hors de nos vi[ll]es](http://conspishorsdenosvies.noblogs.org/) (2011–2012) – and to draw their co-occurrence network.

See [this note](http://www.jean-jaures.org/Publications/Notes/Conspirationnisme-un-etat-des-lieux) and [this note](http://www.joelgombin.fr/mapping-the-french-conspiracist-web-key-findings/) for much more detailed analysis of the same topic.

The plot below shows co-occurrence ties between all topics cited 30 times or more. The most cental keywords are shown in black, others in grey. The grey areas are optimal graph partitions detected through the [Louvain algorithm](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/igraph/functions/multilevel.community).
